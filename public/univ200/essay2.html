			<h2>Colleges: the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="body">
			<p>
				Imagine yourself back at the end of high school, and you're just about to graduate. College is right around the
				corner for you, freedom at last from the burdens of so much homework and burnout from all the classes you've
				taken for the last twelve years of your life. You're excited, and you can't wait to get started. You've been
				told your whole life that college is the key to success, and you're ready to take that key and unlock the door
				to your future. Finally, after the long summer beforehand, you've moved into your dorm, and you are officially
				ready to start your college journey. Finally, some freedom!
				<br><br>
				Little do you know just how much work you'll have to put in to get by in this fantastic new era of your life. No
				more parents to tell you what to do when you need to do it, no more 7 hour days at school, and now you have a
				lot more work to do for your classes. Now you also have to figure out how you're going to pay for this higher
				education, since it's no longer tax funded like most all public schools in the United States. And it doesn't
				just stop there, either. If you don't live on campus, your housing isn't counted on your tuition, so you'll have
				to somehow earn money while you're in school to pay for rent, food, and transportation, if you don't walk to
				your campus.
				<br><br>
				Not only that, but you'll have to learn how to manage your time best you can. With college students spending 17
				hours on average preparing for classes, including homework and studying, you'll have even less free time than
				you did in high school<sup><a href="#duke">[1]</a></sup>. And on top of all that, all the extracurricular
				activities you decide to do will eat up even more precious time that you could use to prepare for class or
				unwind after a long day of classes. Even the work that you decide to do during your studies to afford rent and
				food will have an impact on your time. I think it is safe to say that high school <i>probably</i> didn't prepare
				you for this all that well.
				<br><br>
				The pressure is on young students to learn these important life skills quickly and figure out how to fund your
				expensive endeavour, or risk failing classes, or getting kicked out or dropping out. And that's not even
				mentioning the mental health issues that come with all this stress. It's no wonder that so many students drop
				out of college, or don't even go in the first place. These are many reasons why I believe that colleges are not
				as beneficial as they used to be, and why I believe that they need to change.
			</p>
			<h3 class="section-divider">The Benefits</h3>
			<p>
				Before diving into the bad, it's worth mentioning that college isn't all that bad. There are actually plenty of
				benefits to going to college, including way better job security, higher salaries, and more opportunities to
				learn and grow. Being a college student gives you access to plenty of your campus's resources, such as
				makerspaces, libraries, and laboratories, as well as giving you access to talk to professionals in your field of
				study. This is a great way to learn more about your field of study, as well as get help with your classes. It's
				also a great way to meet new people and make new friends, as well as learn new skills and have fun.
				<br><br>
				Certain fields also require plenty of study before you can get a job within it. For example, becoming a doctor
				requires many years of formal training, training that most students only get through an accredited medical
				school, such as VCU Health. These programs have requirements for students to have completed a certain number of
				college credits, like math, english, and science, as well as meeting a minimum gpa requirement, in the case of
				VCU, a 3.3<sup><a href="#vcu_med">[3]</a></sup>. According to Indeed, jobs like being a registered nurse or a
				nuclear engineer require a college degree<sup><a href="#indeed">[4]</a></sup>.<br><br>

				In addition, college offers many opportunities for students to learn and grow. For example, many colleges offer
				study abroad programs, where students can travel to other countries and learn about their culture and history.
				Colleges also offer many extracurricular activities, such as clubs, sports, and other activities. These
				activities are a great way for students to meet new people and make new friends, as well as learn new skills and
				have fun. Colleges also offer many resources for students to use, such as libraries, computer labs, and other
				resources. These resources are a great way for students to learn and study, as well as get help with their
				classes.<br><br>

				Studies also show that people who graduate with a degree have better salaries and are more likely to be
				employed. According to the Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities, Bachelor's degree holders are half
				as likely to be unemployed and make an average of $1.2 million over their lifetime<sup><a href=#aplu>[14]</a></sup>.
				It's not only employment rates and salaries, but employee benefits as well. This alone can make all the
				difference on if a student goes to college, however there are plenty of drawbacks to studying at college, which
				I will get into next.

			<h3 class="section-divider">Student Debt and Tuition Cost</h3>
			<p>
				One of the biggest, if not <i>the</i> biggest, factors when it comes to pursuing post-secondary education in the
				United States is how much colleges cost. According to the Education Data Initiative, a small team dedicated on
				collecting and organizing statistics about the US education system, a student pursuing a 4 year program at a
				public college or university in their state of residence while living on campus costs, on average, $26,027
				<i>per academic year</i>. This means that, on average, a student pursuing a 4 year program at a public college
				or university in their state of residence will pay $104,108 in tuition alone. This does not include the cost of
				textbooks, housing, food, and other expenses that come with attending college, as well as loan interest<sup><a
						href="#educationdata">[5]</a></sup>.
				<br><br>
				To put a perspective on these numbers, in 1963 the annual cost of a 4 year program at a public university was just
				$263, roughly equivalent to $2,431 in 2022 value. That's enough money to get a mid-high end desktop computer.
				Today, the average cost of tuition per year is roughly equal to a low-mid end car. Imagine basically buying a
				car every year for 4 years, and that's how much it costs to get a 4 year degree at a public
				university in your state of residence. And that's just the average at a public university. The average cost of
				tuition per year at a private college or university is $55,840 when living on campus, roughly equal to a decked
				out Tesla Model Y (according to their website). Per year. Yikes. That's not including the cost of textbooks,
				housing, food, and other expenses that come with attending college, as well as loan interest. In fact, the most
				common reason why students drop out is because of how much college costs<sup><a href="#educationdata">[5]</a> <a
						href="studentassembly">[6]</a></sup>.<br>&nbsp;
			</p>
			<img src="https://educationdata.org/wp-content/uploads/78/average-cost-of-college-and-tuition.webp" alt="Graph showing historical cost data">
			<span><a
					href="https://educationdata.org/average-cost-of-college">https://educationdata.org/average-cost-of-college</a></span>
			<p>
				<br><br>
				Compared to other countries, we have a higher cost of education in the US. Let's take some countries in Europe
				for example. Let's say you're a student living in the EU looking to pursue a bachelors degree. Most countries
				offer much lower, sometimes free, tuition at public universities. Compared to the tens of thousands of dollars
				per student per year in the US, you can probably expect to spend maybe two thousand dollars at the high end in
				most EU countries. There are some outliers to this data, such as private universities in most countries, and the
				United Kingdom, however it should be noted that the cost is still considerably less than the average in the US,
				up to 50% less in some cases<sup><a href="#mastersportal">[7]</a></sup>.
			</p>
			<h3 class="section-divider">Workload and Mental Health</h3>
			<p>
				No matter where you go to school, you are expected to spend some amount of time doing schoolwork outside of
				classes. This is true at any level of education, whether you're in grade school or college, sometimes even while
				you are in the job force. The level of courseload depends on how many classes you take a semester, and for some
				it's just too much. According to a research paper co-authored by Georgia Barbayannis, students at the college
				level are "exposed to novel academic stressors," of which include financial stress, pressure from their family,
				and intense competition<sup><a href="#ncbi2">[9]</a></sup>. As a college student myself, I experience all these
				stresses nearly every day. Financial stress isn't just limited to "Will I be able to eat today" but also
				includes "How am I going to afford this?" As mentioned above, college is expensive, and it's not getting any
				cheaper.
				<br><br>
				Mental health is also a major concern. For many, college is a massive change in their life. Living away from
				home for an extended period of time for the first time in their lives is something not many people will be
				prepared for. This can lead to depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues. According to a study done by
				the National Center for Biotechnology Information, over a third of students that were screened tested positive
				for possible major depressive disorder, with lower gpa seeming to be a major factor<sup><a
						href="#ncbi1">[8]</a></sup>. While this issue isn't limited to college students, it seems to be more prevelent
				due to the stress that students face.
				<br><br>
				Dropping out of college also isn't something that is uncommon. According to the education data initiative, 32.9%
				of undergraduates do not complete their degree. <!--educationdata 2--> Why do these undergrads drop out? Well,
				according to the student assembly, the most common reasons why students drop out is because of the cost of
				tuition and the cost of living, as well as mental health<sup><a href=#studentassembly>[6]</a></sup>. The cost of
				tuition is a major factor, as mentioned above, and the cost of living is also a major factor, as students have
				to pay for rent, food, and other expenses that come with living on their own. Mental health is also a major
				factor, once again as mentioned above.
			</p>
			<h3 class="section-divider">Class Requirements and Diminishing Degree Requirements</h3>
			<p>
				Another major complaint about college is the amount of seemingly random classes some people are required to
				take. General education classes are meant to provide a more rounded education experience, however most students
				feel that this requirement is useless and doesn't add any value to their education. This is especially prevelent
				in STEM fields, such as computer science, or mechanical engineering. These fields require a lot of math and
				science, and students feel that taking classes like english or history is a waste of time and money. This is
				especially true for students who are paying for their own education, as they are paying for classes that they
				don't want to take.<br><br>

				In addition, some jobs are dropping the degree requirement. According to the SHRM, some companies, such as Dell
				and IBM, are dropping the degree requirement in favor of relevant experience, a suitable personality, and a
				willingness to learn<sup><a href="#shrm">[2]</a></sup>. Some are dropping the requirement citing the need for
				diversity in the workplace. In addition, only 44% of jobs listed in 2022 actually require degrees, down from 51%
				in 2017. While this won't keep dropping drastically, this will continue to go down as more companies see the
				need for actual skills and not degree requirements, especially for entry level positions.

				Post-secondary education isn't just limited to college. There are a variety of other options to choose from,
				including trade schools, flight schools, the military, and even just not going to college, although that last
				option isn't exactly the best choice. Each have their own benefits and drawbacks, and here I will explain the
				differences and shortcomings of each, starting with trade schools.<br><br>

				What are trade schools? Trade schools are schools that specialize in teaching students a specific trade, such as
				welding, plumbing, or electrical work. Typically, these schools are less expensive than college, costing around
				$17,000 per year for public trade schools<sup><a href=#bestcolleges>[12]</a></sup>, and with the less time required
				to complete this makes trade schools an affordable option, at least compared to college. However, trade schools
				only teach you your specific trade, meaning certain other skills might not be taught and you will either need to
				go back to get the skills or learn them on your own. Trade schools also have less job opportunities than
				college, however the job security is better, as there will always be a need for tradesmen. Trade schools also
				offer more hands on training, which is a plus for those who learn better by doing rather than listening.<br><br>

				Next up are flight schools, schools that teach people how to fly airplanes. For this case, we will be focusing
				on a commercial pilots license (CPL), which has very different requirements compared to its general aviation
				counterpart, the personal pilots license (PPL). Do note that the cost of flight school depends on the school and
				the individual, especially when starting with zero flight time (meaning you don't already have a PPL), so your
				expenses will be different from everyone else's. For this section, we will be focusing on ATP Flight School. ATP
				Flight School offers a CPL program that costs $104,995 for zero flight time, or $83,995 for those who already
				have a PPL.<sup><a href=#atp>[10]</a></sup> This is a lot of money, slightly more than the average cost of public
				college or university with in-state tuition. Flight school is highly specialized, meaning that if you decide to
				change careers, you will have to go back to school to learn a new trade. It also requires a lot of time to
				complete, a CPL requiring 250 total logged hours, of which 150 must be in an aircraft.<sup><a
						href=#aopa>[11]</a></sup> However, becoming an airline pilot gives you an incredible opportunity to fly to
				places you've never been to. The job security is also very good, considering the world is currently amidst a
				pilot shortage.<br><br>

				Another option is the military. The military offers free education, job security, and hands on training, however
				it is not without its drawbacks. The military requires rigorous training, high stress, and is very time
				consuming. However, if you are willing to put up with all that, the military is a great option for those who
				want to serve their country and get a free education in the process. It can even bring you to be able to fly
				commercially, without spending a hundred grand on the training.<sup><a href=#military.com>[13]</a></sup><br><br>

				Finally, there is the option of not going to college. This is not a good option, however it is still an option.
				If you decide to not go to college, you will have to find a job that doesn't require a college degree, which is
				becoming more and more difficult as time goes on. You will also have to learn how to manage your money, as you
				will have to pay for rent, food, and other expenses that come with living on your own. You will also have to
				learn how to manage your time, as you will have to work to afford rent, food, and other expenses, as well as
				learning how to do your job. Although not the greatest of options on the table, it is still an option
				nonetheless.
			</p>
			<h3 class="section-divider">Conclusion</h3>
			<p>
				In conclusion, the relevance and importance of colleges today are complex and multifaceted. While many employers
				still require college degrees, a declining trend is noted, with some prominent companies like Dell and IBM
				dropping the degree requirement in favor of relevant experience, a suitable personality, and a willingness to
				learn<sup><a href="#shrm">[2]</a></sup>. Professions like medicine still demand formal training, typically acquired
				through accredited institutions, and certain jobs, including registered nursing and nuclear engineering,
				explicitly require a college degree.
				<br><br>
				However, the escalating cost of college education in the United States is a significant barrier. The average
				annual cost for a 4-year program at a public college has drastically risen over the years, far exceeding the
				inflation-adjusted costs from the 1960s<sup><a href="#educationdata">[5]</a></sup>. This financial burden extends
				beyond tuition, encompassing textbooks, housing, food, and other associated expenses, along with loan interests.
				In contrast, many European countries offer much lower or even free tuition at public universities, making
				education more accessible. Moreover, the academic workload and associated stressors in college, including
				financial strain (which is the biggest factor), familial pressure, and intense competition, contribute to mental
				health concerns, and therefore contribute to dropout rates<sup><a href="#studentassembly">[6]</a></sup>. Mental
				health challenges are exacerbated by the substantial life changes that students undergo, particularly when
				living away from home for an extended period.
				<br><br>
				In summary, while colleges offer valuable learning opportunities and are prerequisites for certain professions,
				the escalating costs, coupled with the mental health challenges students face, raise questions about the overall
				effectiveness and accessibility of higher education in the United States.
