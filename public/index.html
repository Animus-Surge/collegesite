          For generations, the path to success has been paved with a single, seemingly unshakable truth: to achieve your dreams, you must go to college. Parents have diligently saved for tuition, guidance counselors have tirelessly promoted higher education, and students have eagerly donned their graduation caps, all in pursuit of a college degree. College has been synonymous with opportunity, a golden ticket to a brighter future. But as the years have passed, a growing chorus of voices has begun to question this long-held belief. Is college truly the panacea it's made out to be, or do people make it sound greater than it actually is?
          <br><br>
          In recent years, a wave of skepticism has washed over the higher education landscape, challenging the idea that colleges are the be-all and end-all of personal and professional success. Rising student debt, stagnant job markets, and the changing nature of work have cast a shadow of doubt over the value of a college degree. The notion that a college education is the only pathway to a fulfilling and prosperous life is increasingly being called into question, and many are beginning to wonder if colleges are, in fact, not as great as we've been led to believe. This page will discuss the issues with the current education system, particularly post-secondary education. It will discuss the increasing cost of tuition and loan debt, as well as how there is little emphasis on skills and experience and the workload of students as a whole.

        <h3 class="section-divider">Student debt and tuition cost</h3>
        <p> <!--Sources: https://educationdata.org/average-cost-of-college ; https://www.mastersportal.com/articles/405/tuition-fees-at-universities-in-europe-in-2023-overview-and-comparison.html-->
          One of the biggest, if not <i>the</i> biggest, factors when it comes to pursuing post-secondary education in the United States is how much colleges cost. According to the Education Data Initiative, a small team dedicated on collecting and organizing statistics about the US education system, a student pursuing a 4 year program at a public college or university in their state of residence costs, on average, $26,027 <i>per academic year</i>. This means that, on average, a student pursuing a 4 year program at a public college or university in their state of residence will pay $104,108 in tuition alone. This does not include the cost of textbooks, housing, food, and other expenses that come with attending college, as well as loan interest.
          <br><br>
          To put a perspective on these numbers, in 1963 the annual cost of a 4 year program at a public college was just $263, roughly equivalent to $2,431 in 2022 value. That's enough money to get a mid-high end desktop computer. Today, the average cost of tuition per year is roughly equal to a low-mid end car. Imagine basically buying a car every year for 4 years, and that's how much it costs to get a 4 year degree at a public college or university in your state of residence. And that's just the average at a public university. The average cost of tuition per year at a private college or university is $55,840 when living on campus, roughly equal to a decked out Tesla Model Y. Per year. Yikes. That's not including the cost of textbooks, housing, food, and other expenses that come with attending college, as well as loan interest.
          <br><br>
          Compared to other countries, we have a higher cost of education in the US. Let's take some countries in Europe for example. Let's say you're a student living in the EU looking to pursue a bachelors degree. Most countries offer much lower, sometimes free, tuition at public universities. Compared to the tens of thousands of dollars per student per year in the US, you can probably expect to spend maybe two thousand dollars at the high end in most EU countries.

        <h3 class="section-divider">The Mismatch of Skills</h3>
        <p>
          Costs and debt are just one of many big issues with the current education system. It might not be the biggest of issues, but another big issue is skill mismatch. In the modern era, the skills that are needed to succeed in the workplace are changing rapidly. However, the skills that are taught in colleges are not changing at the same rate. This means that many students are graduating with skills that are not needed in the workplace, and are not graduating with skills that are needed in the workplace. Something to note is most universities encourage pursuing internships, which are a great way to gain experience in the workplace. However, internships are not a requirement for graduation, and many students do not pursue internships, particularly in fields that do not have as many internship opportunities. Even if a student does pursue an internship, they may not be able to get one, or they may not be able to get one in their field of study due to the level of competition.
          <br><br>
          When it comes to whether a degree is more important or skills are, it depends on the field. For example, in the field of computer science, skills are more important than a degree. This is because the field of computer science is constantly changing, and the skills that are needed to succeed in the field are constantly changing. However, in any of the life sciences fields, a degree can be seen as more important than skills. In computer science (or really anything involving programming or design), skills are more relevent because of what skills are required to do the job. For example, programming requires knowledge of the programming language (or languages) that are used in the job, knowledge that is a lot easier to get on your own. However, in a field like chemistry, a degree is more relevent because of the knowledge that is required to do the job. <!--Sources needed-->

        <h3 class="section-divider">Workload</h3>
        <p>
          No matter where you go to school, you are expected to spend some amount of time doing schoolwork outside of classes. This is true at any level of education, whether you're in grade school or college.
